# Deployment Explanation:
# - We define a Kubernetes Deployment for the Ruby application.
# - We specify one replica and set labels for pod management.
# - The container runs the Ruby application, connects to the database, and listens on port 3000.
# - An initContainer performs database migrations during initialization.

# Service Explanation:
# - We create a Kubernetes Service named 'rubyapp' to expose the Ruby application.
# - It routes traffic to pods with the label 'app: rubyapp' and exposes port 3000.
